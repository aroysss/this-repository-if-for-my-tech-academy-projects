<h1> Sometimes, It's Okay To Be Delusional.</h1>
<p> In life, we go through many obstacles and rollercoasters of emotions and actions. We are responsible for oursleves
and in some cases, small children and other loved ones. It may be too much for us to handle sometimes. Some may think
it is insane to live off of faith and "delusion." I think it's a necessity in this economy and the present world. 
We live in a day and age where minimum wage won't even pay the bills(let alone rent.) I believe that in order to survive
this world, we have to be delusional in some ways. For example, if I have bills I need to pay with no job and no help 
from unemployment/ te government, I'm going to live my life like I have the job that will pay my bills. I'm going to
stop at nothing to think what I need to think or imagine in order to get hired somewhere or some way somehow have next
months bills paid for. You need to believe the voices in your head telling you that you don't belong in bad situations.
Yes, life get rough sometimes but that does not mean you deserve end up in a worst case scenario situation. </p>
<h3> Minumum Wage Vs. "Good" Salaries</h3>
<p> Like I said, minimum wage is not even paying the bills. People who make even $20-$30 an hour still live paycheck to 
paycheck with no extra expenses or luxuries. It is ridiculous, we all do what we have to do though. We are all meant 
to deal with our concequences of our decisions which is why I, personally, refuse to settle. I know my worth as a person,
employee, leader, and any other title that may apply. YOU KNOW YOUR WORTH TOO. I know for a fact no matter how bad I 
think life gets, I will be fine because I said so, no matter the situation. Delusion is what keeps me going. I live life
according to my narrative. It's worked so far, so why not? Employers may not agree because "While my skillset is 
impressive,we've decided to go with someone who better fits our requirements." Cool, I get it, employers need qualified 
employees to get the job done. They don't know me and that's fine becuase one way or another I'm going to get what I 
want. That may sound crazy, but it's true. What is meant for you will not pass you up. We must believe tis to make
ourselves feel better. No matter what life is showing us on a daily, we must believe that it will get better. </p>
